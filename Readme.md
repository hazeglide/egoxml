# EgoXML

This project is a rather hacky parser for x4:foundation savegames. the parser extracts the playerlog and saves it inside a sqlite database.the frontend uses those logs to generate income graphs per ship. 

### Config

``` toml
savegame = "C:/Users/<user>/Documents/Egosoft/X4/<id>/save/save_008.xml"
exclude = ["CJU-133","SBH-279","YSU-034","GLU-716","XYN-441","KMX-925"]

[combine]
SVF-965 = ["REF-314","IIB-734"]
SZS-033 = ["HIL-927","DXJ-278","LTN-250"]

[parser]
shipindex = 0
```
